## Infrared Dance Photography (On going)

I have converted a Canon Rebel to near-infrared-only (750nm-1000nm) cameral. When used right, it creates a highly stage looking scenary under broad day light.

Dancer: Daiane Lopes da Silva

My main Dance Photography site is <http://www.lightisdance.com>, and [Gallery](http://www.lightisdance.com/home/gallery). They are hosted on godaddy.com, which is unbearably slow these days. If anyone has any good suggestions. Please shoot me an email.


## Tap Rapper (2010-2012)
A game to teach kids tap dancing. We built the prototype using motion senstor attached on kid's feet to monitor the movement and give feedback. It turned out that building the prototype was the easy part. Finding the right manufacture to make the device with acceptable cost was very difficult. The project was put on hold till we can resolve the sensor manufacturing challenge. Collaborators: Sachin Deshapande, Ann Marie Garvin, Lee Rousey.

Technologies:
- Motion sensor based interactive feedback.
- Adopted a speech recognition algorithm for movement recognition.

Key achievement:
- In a test with a group of kids on 9 runs, the algorithm, without tweaking, was able to match the expert evaluation 8 out of 9 times in a 1 to 5 scale. The only one missed was off by one.
- Implemented a version using Kinect sensor. If was found that the sensitivity of Kinect was not appropriet for detail feet movement.
